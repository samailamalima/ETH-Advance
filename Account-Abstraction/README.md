# Account Factory

This is a Solidity contract that serves as a factory for creating instances of the `SimpleAccount` contract. It provides functionality for creating accounts, calculating counterfactual addresses, and managing account balances.

## Overview

The `AccountFactory` contract allows users to create new accounts using the `createAccount` function. It utilizes the `ERC1967Proxy` from OpenZeppelin to create upgradeable proxy contracts for each account. The factory contract keeps track of the deployed account instances and their associated balances.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

This contract depends on the following external contracts:

-   `@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Create2.sol`: Provides functions for calculating counterfactual addresses using the CREATE2 opcode.
-   `@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/ERC1967/ERC1967Proxy.sol`: Implements the ERC1967 upgradeable proxy pattern.
-   `SimpleAccount.sol`: The contract that will be used as the implementation for the created accounts.

Make sure to import these contracts into your project before using the `AccountFactory` contract.

### Contract Deployment

The `AccountFactory` contract should be deployed to the Ethereum network. During deployment, an instance of the `SimpleAccount` contract should be passed as a constructor parameter. This `SimpleAccount` contract will serve as the implementation for the created accounts.

### Creating Accounts

To create a new account, call the `createAccount` function, providing the owner's address and a salt value as parameters. The salt is used to calculate the counterfactual address of the account. The function will return the address of the newly created account, or the existing account address if it has already been deployed.

### Calculating Counterfactual Addresses

The `getTheAddress` function allows you to calculate the counterfactual address of an account without actually creating it. It takes the owner's address and a salt value as parameters and returns the computed address based on the `ERC1967Proxy` creation code.

### Managing Balances

The `AccountFactory` contract includes functions for adding funds to a user's account (`addFunds`) and retrieving a user's balance (`getBalance`). The balances are stored in a mapping called `balances`, which associates account addresses with their respective balances.
